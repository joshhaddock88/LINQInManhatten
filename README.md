## General Information

* This is a console application capable of reading data from a json file. We deserialize the json data and filter the output through a sequence of LINQ queries.

## Technologies Used

* C# 9.0
* .Net5 

## Features

Using LINQ Query, we are able to extract the information from the JSON file into text. We are then able to filter out any blank information, and further filter out repeat information.
